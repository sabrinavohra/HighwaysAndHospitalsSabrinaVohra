| 9/09 | 10:10 - 10:35pm | I continued to write pseudocode and think about the problem at a basic level. I didn't make much process, but I tried a for loop solution and a solution with a stack. |

| 9/10 |    2:20-2:30    |                           I thought of a new idea -- using an ArrayList to keep track of the connections for every city and working backwards to find the lowest cost. |
| 9/11 |  1:55 - 2:10pm  |                                                                        I thought through how to create a list to keep track of where possible highways could be built. |
