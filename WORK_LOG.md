| 9/09 | 9:35 - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                              I started brainstorming ideas on how to calculate the minimal cost. I wrote some pseudocode and began testing edge cases. |
| 9/09 |  10:00-10:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                            I tried to use DFS similarly to how it's implemented in MazeSolver, but I decided that is not the strategy. |
| 9/09 | 10:10 - 10:35pm |                                                                                        I continued to write pseudocode and think about the problem at a basic level. I didn't make much progress, but I tried a for loop solution and a solution with a stack to test if either one was the way to go. |
| 9/10 |  1:55 - 2:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                               In class, I thought through the problem with peers and looked through last night's code. |
| 9/10 |    2:20-2:30    |                                                                                        I thought of a new idea -- using an ArrayList to keep track of the connections for every city and working backwards to find the lowest cost, similarly to how search algorithms were implemented in MazeSolver. |
| 9/11 |  1:55 - 2:10pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                        I thought through how to create a list to keep track of where possible highways could be built. |
| 9/11 | 10:00 - 10:45pm |                                                                                                                                    I struggled with figuring out to arrange the data to check how many highways each city has access to. I'm still not entirely sure how to approach sorting the data. |
| 9/16 | 9:25 - 10:00pm  |                                           I looked through the slides and debrief sheet to figure out how to begin the solution. I created a preliminary solution using a union-find algorithm with an array to store the father nodes and comparing the father nodes against each new pair of cities. |
| 9/16 | 10:00 - 10:10pm | I added the return statement calculating the cost as we discussed in class. One of my tests worked! The rest seem to be bigger than the expected value which leads me to believe I forgot an edge case or I'm calculating the number of groups. I will debug both ideas to see where the problem lies. |
| 9/17 |  2:00 - 2:10pm  |                              I noticed that the array I have for the roots (the fathers) of each node is not updating correctly which leads to the total cost being calculated wrong. I am now looking through for any edge cases I missed when going through the cities and adding them to the array. |
| 9/17 |  2:30 - 2:40pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                               I talked to Mr. Blick and learnt that I only need one for-loop. I implemented that idea. |
| 9/17 | 11:50 - 11:55pm |                                                                                                              I looked over my code and thought about edge cases I may have missed but couldn't find the one I'm missing. I cleaned up code and deleted some parts that I had previously commented out. |
| 9/17 |  9:25 - 9:40am  |                                           I looked at the pseudocode that we examined in class and fixed my code based off of it. Although, I decided to compare the root of each node to 0 rather than itself (like if it's its own root).The solution worked after debugging some i indexing errors. |
